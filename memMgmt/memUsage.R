#Measures the time taken for a specific block of code to execute, in this case, a for loop
#The tictoc package provides functions to measure time
#tictoc::tic() starts the timer and records the current time which is used to measure the duration of code execution
#The for loop iterates 100 times
#tictoc::toc() stops the timer
#tic() shows how long the code inside tic() and toc() calls took to execute
